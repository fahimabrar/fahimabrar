I am Abrar Fahim. I am a Data Science and Analytics student at Brunel University London. I have 2 years of experience in the domain of Data Science and AI. I love working with Python, and have the experience of working with R programming. In this Github profile I try to upload my learnings/codings along with explanations(most of the cases).
